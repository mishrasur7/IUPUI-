<h1>Background</h1>

<img src="images/mimosa.jpg" alt="blue mimosa" class="left">Born to an affluent family in Darjeeling, Parijat moved to Kathmandu and pursued her studies in English literature. According to her, having studied many French, Russian and Indian novels in particular, she found herself very disappointed with novels in Nepali literature. Therefore, despite having started out as a poet, she resolved to produce an exceptional Nepali language novel. She wrote four novels while she was studying for her I.A. and B.A. degrees, all of which she burned. Then, she became bed-ridden with illness for three years, and that is when her fifth novel Shirishko Phool was created, which she chose to publish.

<h2>Plot summary</h2>
<p>Suyog meets Sakambari and her two sisters through Sivaraj. Suyog is a lonely middle-aged man and sees the three sisters with eyes of lust. He views Mujura as the quintessential woman with all the feminine virtues and the most logical choice for a wife. However, he is drawn towards Sakambari who is a rebellious personality who does not adhere to the traditional expectations of how a woman should act or dress. He finds his philosophies strongly at odds with Sakambari's and their acquaintance leads him to reevaluate his past life and actions. He comes to accept his acts such as the rape of three women he committed during the war, which he had previously rationalised as acceptable under the peril of immediate death both he and his victims were under at the time, as criminal. Suyog finds himself unable to continue without love or redemption. Reasoning that either Bari will accept him and he will have happiness or she will hurt or kill him for the transgression giving him redemption, Suyog gets hold of her and kisses her. However, Bari simply looks deeply into him and strides off, vanishing into the house. Suyog is left distraught and confused. Months after the incident, he finds out that Sakambari has died.

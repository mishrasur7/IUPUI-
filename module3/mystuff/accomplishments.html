            <p>A typical autumn in Finlnd.</p>
            I first came to Finland on September 18 <sup>th</sup>  2010. It was very beautiful sunny day with colorful leaves of trees. 
            I saw sea for the first time in my life, I was so happy on my arrival in Finland. But on the other hand, there were difficult 
            situation too: new place, new weather, new people, modern society and on top of all these I had to find some sort of job to accomodate 
            myself because I did not think of giving financial pressure to my family back home anymore. After two or three month I was able to 
            find some job to accomodate myself and I was studying and working at the same time. It was not easy. I could not focus on my 
            studies well but I was passing every course with good grades. If you would like to know about my study subject at

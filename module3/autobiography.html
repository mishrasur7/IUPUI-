    <h1>About me and my schooling</h1>

    <p>My name is Suraj Mishra. I was born in August 21 1991 in a remote village of Dhading district of Nepal in a simple family.
        I started to go to school at Bal Jyoti Primary School when I was 6 years old. After studying class one then my parents put 
        me in a english school and I spent 2 years of study there and later I joined Shree Shami Bhanjyang Higher Secondary School from 
        class 5, which was a government school. The school was far and I had to walk about 40 minutes from my home with bag full of books 
        and copies. From the begining of my studies I used to be first in class and everybody loved me there. I liked reading and I was punctual 
        and discplined student in front of teachers eyes. I spent around 6 years in that school and finished my schooling with distinction 
        division. Until that time, I was the first student in the history of school to score distinction division in national school level exam. 
        It was quite a proud moment for me, my parents, and school family. I received honours and prizes from different organizations, political 
        parties and school as well. I have wrote here about my schooling  and I will write more later on but let me list here down what I studied during my school level.

    <p>After finishing my school level, I wanted to go to science stream so I had to go to capital city Kathmandu, which was the nearest possible
        option for me. I leaved my home village with tears where I spent my beautiful 16 years with there stone and mud with both happy and sorrows,
        easy and difficulties. I went to capitol city Kathmandu with high dreams of becoming a great person in my future. I started learning computer. 
        It was the first time when I saw real computer. 
    </p>
    <p>I gave an entrance exam for my higher education in some couple of education institutions and in most of them I got full scholorship because I 
        came from the remote part of country and from government school. At the same time I received a popular <strong>Mahatma Gandhi scholorship</strong>
        from the government of India, which later on supported me financially. 
    </p>
    <h3>My studies at Kamana Higher Secondary Boarding School</h3>
    <p>It was quite challenging for me during the first months at Kamana because of the language. Since I studied in nepali language in my school 
        and then there the study medium was english. The major subjects taht I studied were physics, chemistry and mathematics. I met friends 
        from different parts of country. We had a diversity of background. Some of us became very close and I have some very good friends and I have
        listed their names below in the table.

    <h3>Post Kamana Studies</h3>
    <p>After completing my higher education, I decided to go for foreign studies. Since I had a simple family background I could not afford to 
    foreign education fees I needed to get full scholorship and Finland became my first option because that time education was totally free and still it 
    is free but not for foreign nationalities. Then I gave entrance exam for bachelors program in plastic technology at Arcada University of Applied 
    Sciences from Nepal. I passed an entrance exam and I applied visa from the Finnish embassy in Kathmandu and I came to <strong>Finland</strong>, 
    the beautiful country in the earth. You can know about my studies in Finland from <a href="mystuff/accomplishments.html">here</a>.
